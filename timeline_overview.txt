Phase I: 
The initial phase of this project involves the development of a lightweight graphical user interface (GUI) tool designed to assist users in safely handling potentially malicious URLs. The tool will enable users to input a URL, which will then be automatically processed to generate a defanged version. 

Defanging involves modifying the URL to prevent accidental clicks or execution, typically by replacing characters such as . with [.] and http with hxxp.

Once defanged, the sanitized URL will be displayed within the interface, allowing users to easily copy and use it for secure reporting or analysis purposes.

Phase II: coming soon ...
